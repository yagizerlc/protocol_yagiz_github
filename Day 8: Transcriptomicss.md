# Transcriptomics
The transcriptome can be defined as the complete set of (RNA) transcripts in a cell, or a population of cells, for a specific developmental stage or physiological condition.

The transcriptome can be summarised as the RNA content of a cell.
- Can include messenger RNA (mRNA), non-coding RNA (ncRNA), small RNA (miRNA, piRNA etc.)
- Can also include transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
- Nearly all RNA is single-stranded (ssRNA)

We are always dealing with a snapshot of a dynamic process at the time we collected data

## RNA-Seq
Transcriptome sequencing or RNA-seq is a next-generation sequencing based approach to profiling and analysing RNA. This technique delivers unbiased information without the need for prior knowledge of the genome or transcriptome.

Transcriptome sequencing is often the method of choice for analysis of differentially expressed genes, as well as for RNA editing and profiling of allele-specific gene expression. RNA-seq can also be used to investigate splicing patterns, splicing variants, gene isoforms, single nucleotide polymorphisms and post transcriptional modifications.

Transcriptome sequencing begins with isolating RNA and converting this RNA into so-called complementary DNA (cDNA). Total RNA or RNA types like mRNA or small RNA can be investigated. Strand-specific or random-primed libraries can be created based on how the cDNA is synthesised. Once adapters are ligated to the cDNA fragments, the cDNA undergoes single-read or paired-end sequencing. The sequencing reads are either assembled de novo or they are aligned to a reference genome or transcriptome.

There are different types of RNA-Seq techniques:
1. Total RNA Sequencing
2. mRNA Sequencing
3. RNA Exome Sequencing
4. Targeted RNA Sequencing
5. Single Cell Sequencing
